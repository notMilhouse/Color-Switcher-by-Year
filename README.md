# Color-Switcher-by-Year
A simple solution for changing component's color based on a year following a sequence of colors.

When developing a website for a school club, I wanted to make the interface color change based on the senior year students shirt color. Since every class has its own shirt and its color follows a sequence, this solution basically just makes a calculation based on the year and the number of possible colors (7 in this case) to define which color to pick.
